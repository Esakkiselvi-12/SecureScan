        <h2>Why SecureScan?</h2>

        <p>
            SecureScan is a beginner-friendly web vulnerability scanning tool designed
            for educational and academic purposes. This application helps users
            understand how basic reconnaissance techniques work in cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scanner identifies commonly exposed network services by checking
            standard ports used by web servers, databases, and remote access services.
            It also resolves domain names into IP addresses for analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            SecureScan is intended for students, cybersecurity learners, and demo
            projects. It does not perform aggressive penetration testing and should
            only be used on websites you own or have permission to test.
        </p>

    <h2>How SecureScan Works</h2>
    <p>
        SecureScan works by performing a lightweight network scan on the given
        website or IP address. When a user submits a target, the backend Flask
        server processes the request and dynamically selects commonly used ports
        based on the type of service detected. These ports are then tested using
        socket connections to determine whether they are open or closed. Open
        ports may indicate exposed services which, if misconfigured, could lead
        to security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

<div class="section-box">
    <h2>Open Port Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Open ports are communication endpoints that allow data to flow between
        a server and external systems. While some ports such as 80 (HTTP) and
        443 (HTTPS) are necessary for web services, other open ports like FTP,
        SSH, or database ports can pose a risk if left unprotected. SecureScan
        identifies these ports to help users understand potential attack surfaces
        in their systems.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <h2>Server Header Inspection</h2>
    <p>
        SecureScan also inspects HTTP response headers returned by the target
        server. These headers sometimes reveal information about the web server
        software and its version. Exposing such details can assist attackers in
        targeting known vulnerabilities. This tool highlights whether the server
        information is visible or properly hidden as a basic security measure.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This application is developed strictly for educational and academic use.
        It helps students, beginners, and cybersecurity enthusiasts gain hands-on
        experience in understanding basic vulnerability assessment techniques.
        SecureScan does not perform brute-force attacks, exploit vulnerabilities,
        or bypass authentication mechanisms. Users are strongly advised to scan
        only systems they own or have explicit permission to test.
    </p>

<div class="section-box">
    <h2>Limitations of SecureScan</h2>
    <p>
        SecureScan is a beginner-friendly vulnerability scanner and does not
        replace professional penetration testing tools. It does not detect
        advanced vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
        or zero-day exploits. However, it provides a strong foundation for
        understanding how basic security assessments are performed in real-world
        environments.
